<!-- I made this webpage as a sort of joke for me and my friend who listen to this album almost every time we hang out. With it already being on Youtube, I don't think it'll be much trouble having it on such a small site that's almost impossible to look up in the first palce. If you still somehow see this message and are concerned, please contact me, for I'd be more than happy to take the file down if needed. -->
